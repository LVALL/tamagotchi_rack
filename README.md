# **Welcome to my "Tamagothi" game interpretation**
This game is created for people, who can't get themselves a pet 
in the real world, but really want to take care of someone 
(yeah, yeah, exactly, I'm talking about people like me).
## How to start game?
All you need to do is run command in terminal to configure your Gemfile:
```bash
bundle install
```
Than run the server:
```bash
rackup
```
And go to:
http://localhost:9292

Login with:
* name: user
* password: password

Enter your pet name and play with him )
## Rules
Yes, I almost forgot to write the list of rules, because I seem it so boring
* MAIN rule is don't let your pet die, how will you do it - not my problem )
* Use alerted hints to do something with your pet
